# OpenGL-Ray-Tracing

This project is a heavily commented implementation of the mini ray tracer introduced in the book  <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>. The book serves as an excellent introduction to ray tracing for beginners, offering a hands-on guide to creating a simple ray tracer from scratch. Personally, I enjoyed it greatly. However, it might be challenging to follow the code, with certain logic and concepts not always immediately clear.

To address this, I have added extensive comments throughout the code. These comments include:

- **Explanations of the code logic**: breakdowns of key sections to help you understand the flow and purpose of each block.
- **Quotes from the book**: relevant quotes that reinforce the learning experience, directly tying the code to its corresponding theoretical explanation.
- **Additional notes**: insights from other sources to clarify complex concepts or provide further context.

The goal of this project is to make the ray tracing code more approachable and informative for those using it as a study tool.
